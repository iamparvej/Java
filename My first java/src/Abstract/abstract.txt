Abstract Method in Java:
->The abstract method  is used for creating blueprints for classes or interfaces.
->methods are defined but these methods don't provide the implementation.
->Abstract Methods can only be implemented using subclasses or classes that implement the interfaces.

# Important Points for Abstract Method
->Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared abstract.
->If a class contains an abstract method it needs to be abstract and vice versa is not true.
