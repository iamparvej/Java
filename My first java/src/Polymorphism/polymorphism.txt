Polymorphism;-
Polymorphism comes from Greek:

“poly” = many, “morph” = forms → "Many Forms"
polymorphism means an object can take on many forms. The most common use is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.



🧠 Why Use Polymorphism?
Polymorphism helps in:

Writing generic code.
Achieving runtime flexibility.
Supporting method overriding, which is essential for dynamic behavior.

✅ Types of Polymorphism in Java
1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding / Method Overloading)
Definition:
->When method call is resolved at compile time it's called compile- time polymorphism

➕ Method Overloading:
# Same method name with different :
Number of parameters
Types of parameters
order of parameters

2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding / Method Overriding)
Definition:
-> When method call is resolved at runtime it's called runtime polymorphism


🔁 Method Overriding:
Method in subclass has same signature as in superclass.
The object type (not the reference type) determines which method is executed
