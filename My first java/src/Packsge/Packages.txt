📦 What is a Package in Java?
->A package is a group of related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages.
->Think of it as a folder in your computer where similar types of files are stored together.

🔶 Why Use Packages?
✅ Avoid name conflicts (e.g., two classes with the same name).

✅ Improve modularity of the application.

✅ Easier to manage large codebases.

✅ Access control with public, private, protected, and default access.

✅ Reusability of code.

📂 Types of Packages in Java.
1. 🔸 Built-in Packages (Standard Library)
Provided by Java, used directly with import.

Examples:

java.util.* → collections, Scanner, Date, etc.

java.io.* → Input/output classes

java.net.* → Networking

java.sql.* → Database access

2. 🔸 User-defined Packages
->Created  by the programmer 
✅ Steps:
Create a class with a package statement.

Save it in a folder with the same name as the package.

Compile using javac -d . FileName.java

Use import to access it.
