 Interfaces :-
-> An interface in java programing language is defined as an abstract tape used to specify the behaviour of a class .
->An interface in java is blueprint of behaviour .
->A java  Interfaces  contain static constants and abstract methods

# key point of  Interfaces 
The  Interfaces on java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction
By default variables in an interface are public,static,and final.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java.
It support loose coupling (classes depend on behaviour ,not implementation
In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
An interface in Java defines a set of behaviours that a class can implement, usually representing an IS-A relationship, but not always in every scenario.

# Relationship Between Class and Interface
->A class can extend another class, and similarly.
->interface can extend another interface
