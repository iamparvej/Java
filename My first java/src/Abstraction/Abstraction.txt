Abstraction:-
->Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing the essential details or features to the user.

-> It allows to focus on what an object does rather than how.

->The unnecessary details are not displayed to the user.

Key features of abstraction:
->Abstraction hides the complex details and shows only essential features.

->Abstract classes may have methods without implementation and must be implemented by subclasses.

->By abstracting functionality, changes in the implementation do not affect the code that depends on the abstraction

How to Achieve Abstraction:
# Java provides two ways to implement abstraction, which are listed below:
1.Abstract Classes (Partial Abstraction)
2.Interface (100% Abstraction)

1.Abstract Classes:
An abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword.
An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
An abstract class may have both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).
Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with an abstract keyword
There can be no object of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the new operator.

2.Interface
Interfaces are another method of implementing abstraction in Java.
The key difference is that, by using interfaces, we can achieve 100% abstraction in Java classes
 In Java or any other language, interfaces include both methods and variables but lack a method body.
